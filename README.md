Each episode of this program presents, with humor and simplicity, and in less than 2 minutes, linguistic, etymological, orthographic, and grammatical difficulties of the French language. Viewers can ask Bernard CERQUIGLINI questions about the French language's subtleties which answer will be directly broadcast.

"Merci professeur !" is probably the most accessible and interesting program about the French language. There are hundreds of episodes available on the Internet. However, these episodes are not greatly highlighted on TV5MONDE web site, while they could be integrated in a free mobile application that would push a new episode to the subscribers, for instance, every morning, to enjoy with a coffee and croissants. :)

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find a way to hack TV5MONDE Web site's data, to download and rebuild the episode videos. As always, should you be caught, the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions. Good luck.
